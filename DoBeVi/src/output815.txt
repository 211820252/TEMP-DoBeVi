### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem:

**Given:**
1. `n > 0` (i.e., `n` is a positive integer).
2. For all `x`, `p(x) = x² - x + 41` (where `-` is natural number subtraction, so if `x² < x`, `p(x)` is not necessarily `x² - x + 41` but rather `0 + 41` because `x² - x` is `0`).
3. `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` (i.e., `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) ≥ 2`).

**Prove:** `n ≥ 41`.

However, upon closer inspection, the problem in Lean is that `p(x) = x² - x + 41` is interpreted as `(x² - x) + 41`, where `-` is truncated subtraction. This is crucial because if `x = 1`, `x² - x = 0` (`1 - 1 = 0`), so `p(1) = 0 + 41 = 41`. Similarly, for `x = 0`, `p(0) = (0 - 0) + 41 = 41`. The condition `n > 0` does not help much here, but if `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` may still be `1` or even `2` for small `n`.

But the problem states `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` (`gcd ≥ 2`), and we must prove that `n ≥ 41`. 

However, this is **not true as stated**:
- Take `n = 40`. Then `p(40) = 40² - 40 + 41 = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601`, and `p(41) = 41² - 41 + 41 = 1681`. Now, `gcd(1601, 1681) = 41` (`1681 = 41²`, `1601 ≡ 41 mod 41` because `1601 = 41 * 39 + 2`, but wait `1601 = 41 * 39 + 2` is incorrect, `41 * 39 = 1599`, `1601 - 1599 = 2`, so `1601 ≡ 2 mod 41`. But `1681 = 41² ≡ 0 mod 41`, and `gcd(1601, 1681) = gcd(1601, 41 * 41)`. Since `1601 ≡ 2 mod 41`, `gcd(1601, 41 * 41) = gcd(2, 41 * 41) = gcd(2, 1681) = 1`. 

Oops, I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Actually, `gcd(1601, 1681)` is `gcd(1601, 80)` because `1681 - 1601 = 80` and `1601 = 20 * 80 + 1` (`80 * 20 = 1600`, `1601 - 1600 = 1`), so `gcd(1601, 80) = gcd(80, 1) = 1`. 

Thus, for `n = 40`, `gcd(p(40), p(41)) = 1`, so `n = 40` does not violate the statement (but it would violate the hypothesis `gcd > 1`). 

But `n = 42`: `p(42) = 42² - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763` (`42² = 1764`, `1764 - 42 = 1722`, `1722 + 41 = 1763`), `p(43) = 43² - 43 + 41 = 1849 - 43 + 41 = 1847` (`1849 - 43 = 1806`, `1806 + 41 = 1847`). Now, `gcd(1763, 1847)` is `gcd(1763, 1847 - 1763 = 84)`, `1763 = 21 * 84 + 17`, `gcd(84, 17) = gcd(17, 84 - 4 * 17 = 16)`, `gcd(17, 16) = 1`. So again, `gcd = 1`.

This is getting confusing. Let's find `n` such that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`.

Let's try `n = 80`: `p(80) = 80² - 80 + 41 = 6400 - 80 + 41 = 6361` (`80² = 6400`, `6400 - 80 = 6320`, `6320 + 41 = 6361`), `p(81) = 81² - 81 + 41 = 6561 - 81 + 41 = 6521` (`81² = 6561`, `6561 - 81 = 6480`, `6480 + 41 = 6521`). Now, `gcd(6361, 6521)` is `gcd(6361, 160)` (`6521 - 6361 = 160`), `6361 = 39 * 160 + 1` (`39 * 160 = 6240`, `6361 - 6240 = 121`), `160 - 121 = 39`, `121 = 3 * 39 + 4`, `39 = 9 * 4 + 3`, `4 = 1 * 3 + 1`, so `gcd = 1`.

This is still not working. 

But notice that in Lean, `p(x) = x² - x + 41` with `x² - x` being truncated subtraction (`max(0, x² - x)`):
- For `x = 1`, `x² - x = 1 - 1 = 0`, `p(1) = 41`.
- For `x = 2`, `x² - x = 4 - 2 = 2`, `p(2) = 43`.
- For `x = 0`, `x² - x = 0 - 0 = 0`, `p(0) = 41`.
But if `x = 14`, `x² - x = 196 - 14 = 182`, `p(14) = 223`.
`p(15) = 225 - 15 + 41 = 251`. `gcd(223, 251) = 1`.

But perhaps the problem is interpreted differently, because the actual minimal `n` is not obvious here. 

Alternatively, notice that for `n = 1`, `p(1) = 41`, `p(2) = 43`, `gcd = 1`.
For `n = 41`, `p(41) = 41² - 41 + 41 = 1681`, `p(42) = 42² - 42 + 41 = 1763`.
`gcd(1681, 1763) = gcd(1681, 1763 - 1681 = 82)`, `gcd(1681, 82) = gcd(82, 1681 - 20 * 82 = 82 - 1681 + 1640 = 82 - 41 = 41)` (`82 * 20 = 1640`, `1681 - 1640 = 41`), `gcd(82, 41) = 41 > 1`. 

Thus, the smallest `n` is `n = 41`.

But the statement is `41 ≤ n`, which is true in this case, because `n` cannot be less than `41` to satisfy `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` (since we have not found any such `n` below `41`).

But is it true that for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`? Let's check `n = 40`:
`p(40) = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601`, `p(41) = 1681`. We saw earlier that `gcd(1601, 1681) = 1`.

But perhaps in Lean, `p(40)` is `40² - 40 + 41 = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601` (correct) and `p(41)` is `41² - 41 + 41 = 1681` (correct), so it seems `gcd(1601, 1681) = 1`.

Similarly, for `n = 39`, `p(39) = 39² - 39 + 41 = 1521 - 39 + 41 = 1523`, `p(40) = 1601`, `gcd(1523, 1601) = gcd(1523, 78)` (`1601 - 1523 = 78`), `1523 = 19 * 78 + 11` (`78 * 19 = 1482`, `1523 - 1482 = 41`), so `gcd(1523, 78) = gcd(78, 41)` (`41 * 19 = 779`, `1482 - 779 = 703`), `gcd(78, 41) = gcd(41, 37) = gcd(37, 4) = gcd(4, 1) = 1`. 

This suggests that for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`. 

If that's the case, the statement `41 ≤ n` is true under the given condition `gcd > 1`.

To prove it, we can:
1. Assume for contradiction that `n < 41`.
2. Check all cases `n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 40}` to ensure that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.

But checking `40` cases is tedious. We need a smarter approach.

**Observation:** For `n < 41`, `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)` are not divisible by any prime `≤ 41`. This is not entirely accurate, as `p(1) = 41` is divisible by `41`.

But perhaps the key is that for `n < 41`, no prime can divide both `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)`.

Alternatively, we can calculate `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` as follows:
`p(n) = n² - n + 41`, `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + n + 41`.
So `p(n + 1) - p(n) = n`.

Thus, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), n)` because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`.

Now, `p(n) = n² - n + 41 = n(n - 1) + 41`. 

Since `n(n - 1)` is always even (as one of `n` or `n - 1` is even), `p(n)` and `n` have the same parity:
- If `n` is even, `p(n)` is even (`n² - n` is even, so `p(n)` is odd? Wait no: if `n` is even, `n² - n` is even (`n² ≡ n mod 2`), so `p(n)` is `even + 41 = odd`). 

Wait, no! The parity is reversed:
- If `n` is even, `n² ≡ 0 mod 2` and `-n ≡ 0 mod 2`, so `n² - n ≡ 0 mod 2`, so `p(n) ≡ 0 + 41 ≡ 1 mod 2`.
- If `n` is odd, `n² ≡ 1 mod 2` and `-n ≡ 1 mod 2`, so `n² - n ≡ 0 mod 2`, so `p(n) ≡ 0 + 41 ≡ 1 mod 2`.

Thus, `p(n)` is always odd. Therefore, if `gcd(p(n), n) = d > 1`, then `d` must be odd and `d` divides `p(n) = n² - n + 41` and `d` divides `n`. 

Thus, `d` divides `p(n) - (n² - n) = 41`.

So the only possible common divisors are `d = 41`. 

Thus, `gcd(p(n), n)` is either `1` or `41`.

But if `gcd(p(n), n) = 41`, then `41` divides `n` and `p(n) = n² - n + 41`, so `41` divides `n² - n`. Since `41` divides `n`, `41` divides `n² - n`, so no contradiction. But we need to check whether `n` is divisible by `41` to have `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), n) > 1`.

In fact, if `n < 41` and `n > 0`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), n)` is `1` because `n < 41` and `41` does not divide `n`.

But we must be careful: `gcd(p(n), n)` can still be `41` only if `n` is a multiple of `41`, but `n < 41` implies `n` is not a multiple of `41` (since `n > 0`), so `gcd(p(n), n) = 1`. 

Thus, for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`, and the hypothesis `gcd > 1` cannot hold, so `n ≥ 41`.

However, we must ensure that when `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), n) = 1`. Since `p(n) ≡ 41 mod n` (`n² - n ≡ 0 mod n`), `gcd(p(n), n) = gcd(41, n)`. So, if `n < 41`, `gcd(41, n)` is `1` unless `n` is a multiple of `41`. But since `n < 41` and `n > 0`, `n` cannot be a multiple of `41`. Thus, `gcd(41, n) = 1`, so `gcd(p(n), n) = 1`.

This is the key observation! Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), n) = gcd(41, n) = 1` if `n < 41`.

But we are given `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, so this is impossible if `n < 41`, meaning `n ≥ 41`.

**Summary of the Proof:**
1. Compute `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1) - p(n)) = gcd(p(n), n)`.
2. Since `p(n) ≡ 41 mod n` (because `p(n) = n² - n + 41 ≡ 0 - 0 + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`), `gcd(p(n), n) = gcd(41, n)`.
3. If `n < 41` and `n > 0`, then `gcd(41, n) = 1` (since `41` is prime and `n` is not divisible by `41`).
4. Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1` if `n < 41`, which contradicts `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`.
5. Hence, `n ≥ 41`.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand `p(n)`**:
   - For `n ≥ 1`, `n² ≥ n`, so `p(n) = n² - n + 41` (no truncation in subtraction).
   - For `n = 0`, `n² - n = 0` (truncation does not affect here).

2. **Relate `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` to `gcd(p(n), n)`**:
   - Compute `p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`.
   - Actually, `p(n + 1) - p(n) = n² + n + 41 - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`.
   - No! Wait: `p(n) = n² - n + 41`, `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + n + 41`.
   - So `p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`.
   - Thus, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.
   - Further simplification: `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.

   But in the initial observation, I mistakenly wrote `p(n + 1) - p(n) = n`. 

   **Correction:** 
   - Actually, `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + n + 41`.
   - So `p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`.
   - Thus, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.

   Further simplification:
   - `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.
   - Note that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)`, but `n² - n + 41` is not obviously related to `2n`.

   Alternatively, we can write `n² - n + 41 = n(n - 1) + 41`, and `gcd(n(n - 1) + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)` because:
   - `gcd(n(n - 1) + 41, 2n) = gcd(n(n - 1) + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)`, since `n(n - 1)` is divisible by `2` (`n(n - 1)` is always even), so `gcd(n(n - 1), 2n)` divides `2n` and is `2n` times a factor, but since `n(n - 1)` is even, `gcd` divides `2n`.

   No, this is not correct. 

   Actually, we can factor `2n` as follows:
   - `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41 - n(2n), 2n) = gcd(-n² - n + 41, 2n)` is not helpful.

   Alternatively, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41 - n(n - 1), 2n)`.

   The correct approach is to note that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`, but also `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2(n² - n + 41) - n * 2n = 2(-n + 41)`, so `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2(-n + 41)`.

   However, `gcd(a, b)` also divides any linear combination of `a` and `b`. Here, we can find `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` by noting that it must divide `41`. 

   But `n² - n + 41` and `2n` cannot both be divisible by any prime other than `41`, because:

   Suppose `d` divides `n² - n + 41` and `d` divides `2n`. Then `d` divides `2n * (n - 1) = 2n² - 2n`. Also, `d` divides `4 * (n² - n + 41) = 4n² - 4n + 164`.

   So `d` divides `4n² - 4n + 164 - (2n² - 2n) = 2n² - 2n + 164`.

   Now, `d` divides `(2n² - 2n + 164) - 2n * (n - 1) = 164`.

   Thus, `d` divides `164 = 4 * 41`. So `d` is `1`, `2`, `4`, `41`, `82`, or `164`.

   However, since `p(n) ≡ 41 mod 2` (as `n² - n` is even), `p(n)` is odd. So `d` cannot be `2` or `4` (as `2` and `4` are even). Thus, `d` is `1`, `41`, `82`, or `164`.

   But if `d` divides `82 = 2 * 41`, then `d` is `1`, `2`, `41`, `82`. But `d` cannot be `2`. If `d` divides `164`, `d` is `1`, `2`, `4`, `41`, `82`, `164`. 

   This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to note that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(41, 2n)`, because `gcd(n² - n, 2n) = 2n * gcd((n² - n)/(2n), 1)`, but `(n² - n)` is `n(n - 1)`, so `gcd(n(n - 1), 2n)` is `2 * gcd(n(n - 1)/2, n)`.

   Alternatively, we can observe that for `n ≤ 40`, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = 1` (since `n² - n + 41` is not divisible by `2` or any prime dividing `n`, but this is not true because if `n` is even, `n² - n` is even).

   The **correct observation** is that for `n < 41`, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)` is `gcd(41, 2n)` because `n² - n ≡ 0 mod n` (`n² - n = n(n - 1)`). So `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)`, since `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)`.

   (This is because `gcd(a + k * b, b) = gcd(a, b)` for any integers `a, b, k`. Here, `a = 41`, `b = n`, and `k = 1` in `n² - n`.)

   Alternatively, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41 + n(n - 1), 2n)`. Since `n(n - 1)` is always even, `gcd(41 + n(n - 1), 2n)` divides `gcd(41, 2n)` (because `n(n - 1)` is divisible by `2`, and `gcd(a + k, m) = gcd(a, m)` if `m` divides `k`). 

   But here, we can write `n(n - 1) = 2 * k`, so `gcd(41 + 2k, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)`.

   Therefore, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)`. 

   This is because `n(n - 1)` is always even, so we can write `n² - n + 41 = 2k + 41`, and `gcd(2k + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(41, 2n)` because `gcd(2k + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)` (as `2k` is a multiple of `2`).

   In fact, `gcd(2k + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)` because:
   - Any common divisor of `2k + 41` and `2n` divides `41 * 2n - n * (2k + 41) = 41n - 41n = 0`, and any common divisor of `41` and `2n` divides `2k + 41` (if `d` divides both `41` and `2n`, it divides `41` and `2n`, but since `d` divides `2n` and `2k + 41`, it must divide `k`, which it need not necessarily).

   This seems tricky, so instead, we can observe that `gcd(2k + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, 2n)` because:
   - `gcd(2k + 41, 2n)` divides `41 * (2k + 41) - 41 * (2k + 41) = 0`... wait, that's not useful.

   Alternatively, note that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2 * (n² - n + 41) - n * 2n = 82`. So `d` divides `82`.

   Also, `d` divides `n² - n + 41` and `2n`. So `d` divides `2(n² - n + 41) - (2n - 2)(n - 1) = 2(n² - n + 41) - (2n² - 4n + 2n - 2) = 2(n² - n + 41) - (2n² - 2n - 2) = 2n² - 2n + 82 - 2n² + 2n + 2 = 84`.

   So `d` divides `84`.

   Thus, `d` divides `gcd(82, 84) = 2`. But `n² - n + 41` is odd (as `n² - n` is even), so `d` is odd. Hence, `d = 1`.

   Therefore, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = 1` for all `n`.

   But this contradicts our earlier examples, such as `n = 41` where `gcd(1681, 82) = gcd(1681, 82) = 41`.

   **Error identified:** In `n = 41`, `p(n) = 1681`, `p(n + 1) = 1763`, and `gcd(1681, 1763) = 41`, but `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 82`, not `2 * 41 = 82`. So `gcd(1681, 1763) = gcd(1681, 82) = 41` (since `1763 - 2 * 1681 = -2 * 41 = -82`).

   Thus, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is not `gcd(41, 2n)` in general.

   **Alternative Correct Approach:**

   Compute `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + n + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` (since `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`).

   Now, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41 - (n² - n - 41), 2n) = gcd(82 - n² + n, 2n)`, which is not directly helpful.

   Another approach is to note that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, 4n)` because it divides `2n`, and then to relate `gcd(n² - n + 41, 4n)` to `41`.

   But in general, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(41, 2n)` only if `n² - n ≡ 0 mod 41`.

   However, this seems complicated. Instead, perhaps the initial assumption that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), n)` is correct because:
   - `p(n + 1) = p(n) + 2n`.
   - So `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n)`.
   - Then `gcd(p(n), 2n)` divides `gcd(p(n), 4n)`, etc., but not obviously.

   But in Lean, we have `p(x) = x² - x + 41` is not `x² - x + 41` in the integers, but rather `(x² - x) + 41` with `-` as truncated subtraction.

   However, if `x ≥ 1`, then `x² ≥ x`, so `x² - x` is `x² - x` (no truncation).

   The confusion arises because in Lean, the condition is `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`, where `Nat.gcd` is the usual gcd.

   But in Lean, `p(x) = (x² - x) + 41`, and if `n = 0`, `p(0) = (0 - 0) + 41 = 41`, but `n > 0`.

   **Reassessing the problem:**
   - The theorem states: if `n > 0` and `p(n) = n² - n + 41` (for `n > 0`, this is exact), and `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`.
   - We need to show that for `n ≤ 40`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.
   - To do this, we can check all `n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 40}` that `gcd(n² - n + 41, (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41) = 1`.

   But `(n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + n + 41`.

   So, `gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + n + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.

   Now, as before, `n² - n + 41` is always odd (`n² - n` is always even, `41` is odd).

   So `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` because `n² - n + 41` is odd and `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b)`.

   Wait, `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`, so `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` if `a` is odd, because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - 2a)` (not sure).

   Alternatively, `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` if `a` is odd, because `gcd(a, 2b)` divides `gcd(a, b)` (since `a` and `2b` have the same odd part).

   No, not necessarily. But in our case, `a = n² - n + 41` is odd, and `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` because `gcd(a, 2n) = gcd(a, n)` when `a` is odd.

   Alternatively, `gcd(a, 2n)` divides `gcd(a, n)`. 

   But `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`, because `n² - n + 41 ≡ -n + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`.

   So, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + n + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, n)` (since `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`).

   No, that's not correct. Actually, `gcd(a, 2n)` is `gcd(a, n)` when `a` is odd. 

   Therefore, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`.

   This is because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)` and `n² - n + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`.

   Therefore, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`.

   Now, if `n < 41`, then `gcd(41, n) = 1` because `41` is prime and `n` is not a multiple of `41`.

   Thus, for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.

   Therefore, if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

   **Conclusion:**
   - The only condition is `n > 0`, but we have shown that for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.
   - Hence, if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

### Step 1: Prove that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`

First, we must confirm that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, n)`.

We know that:
1. `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` if `a` is odd.
   - This is because `gcd(a, 2b)` must divide `gcd(a, b)` (since `a` is odd and `2b` can only contribute even factors to `gcd`, but `a` is odd). The reverse is not necessarily true unless `a` and `2b` share some factors, but in general, `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` when `a` is odd.
   - Alternatively, note that `gcd(a, 2b)` divides `a` and `2b`, so it divides `gcd(a, b)` because it must divide `b` (since it divides `a` and `gcd(a, 2b)` is co-prime to `2` unless `a` is even, but `a` is odd here).
   - Similarly, `gcd(a, b)` divides `a` and `b`, so it divides `2b`. Moreover, `gcd(a, b)` is co-prime to `2` because `a` is odd. Thus, `gcd(a, b)` divides `gcd(a, 2b)`.
   - Therefore, `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` when `a` is odd.

   Here, `a = n² - n + 41` is odd, and `b = n`, so `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`.
   - Further, `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)` because `n² - n + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`.

   Thus, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) = gcd(41, n)`.

### Step 2: For `n < 41`, `gcd(41, n) = 1`

If `n < 41` and `n > 0`, then `n` cannot be a multiple of `41` because `41` is prime and `n < 41`. Therefore, `gcd(41, n) = 1`.

### Step 3: Conclude `n ≥ 41`

If `n < 41`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n) = 1`, which contradicts the assumption that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`. Therefore, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

However, there is a small gap in Step 1: We assumed `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` for `a` odd. Let's prove this:
- Let `d = gcd(a, 2b)`. Then `d` divides `a` and `2b`. Since `a` is odd, `d` is odd and divides `gcd(a, b)`.
- Conversely, `gcd(a, b)` divides `a` and `b`, so it divides `2b`, and is co-prime to `2` (`a` is odd), so `gcd(a, b)` divides `gcd(a, 2b)`.
- Therefore, `gcd(a, 2b) = gcd(a, b)` when `a` is odd.

This completes the proof sketch.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Compute `p(n + 1) - p(n)`**:
   - `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + n + 41`.
   - `p(n) = n² - n + 41`.
   - `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n`.
   - Thus, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n)`.

2. **Simplify `gcd(p(n), 2n)`**:
   - Since `p(n) = n² - n + 41` is always odd (because `n² - n` is even and `41` is odd), `gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(p(n), n)`.

3. **Further simplify `gcd(p(n), n)`**:
   - `gcd(p(n), n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)` because `n² - n ≡ 0 mod n`.

4. **Conclude `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`**:
   - Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`.

5. **Check `n < 41`**:
   - If `n < 41`, then `gcd(41, n) = 1` because `41` is prime and `n` is not divisible by `41` (as `n < 41`).

6. **Obtain contradiction for `n < 41`**:
   - Given `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

### Lean 4 Proof with `have` Statements

```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_618 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) (p : ℕ → ℕ) (h₀ : ∀ x, p x = x ^ 2 - x + 41)
    (h₁ : 1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))) : 41 ≤ n := by

  have h₆ : 1 < Nat.gcd (41 : ℕ) n → 41 ≤ n := by sorry
  have h₇ : 41 ≤ n := by sorry

This proof sketch outlines the steps, and each `have` statement corresponds to a key step in the reasoning process.

### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, let's understand the problem:

We have a natural number `n > 0` and a function `p(x) = x² - x + 41` (interpreted as a natural number operation). The hypothesis is that the greatest common divisor of `p(n)` and `p(n+1)` is at least 2, and we need to prove that `n ≥ 41`.

But, upon closer inspection, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` does not necessarily mean that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) ≥ 2` if `Nat.gcd` can be `0`. However, since `p(x)` is always positive (`x² - x + 41 ≥ 41` for `x ≥ 0`), the `Nat.gcd` cannot be `0`. But we need to confirm this:
- For `x = 0`: `p(0) = 0 - 0 + 41 = 41` (Lean uses `x² - x` with truncated subtraction, so `0 - 0 + 41 = 41`).
- For `x = 1`: `p(1) = 1 - 1 + 41 = 41`.
- For `x ≥ 2`, `x² - x ≥ 2`, so `p(x) ≥ 43`. Thus, `p(x)` is always `≥ 41`.

But in Lean, subtraction is truncated, so for example `x = 42`:
- `p(42) = 42² - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763`.
But Lean interprets `1764 - 42` as `1722`, so `p(42) = 1722 + 41 = 1763`.
But wait, in Lean, is it `(x² - x) + 41` or `x² - (x + 41)`? The Lean statement says `x ^ 2 - x + 41`, which parses as `(x ^ 2 - x) + 41` (since subtraction and addition are at the same precedence level and associate to the left). 

But according to the Lean documentation, `-` is left-associative, and `Nat.sub` is the truncated subtraction, meaning that if `a < b`, then `a - b = 0`. 

But `x² - x + 41` for `x = 1`: 
In Lean, `(1 : ℕ) ^ 2 - 1 + 41` = `(1 - 1) + 41` = `0 + 41` = `41`.

But in math, `x² - x + 41` is `1 - 1 + 41 = 41`. So they agree here.

For `x = 42`:
Lean: `(42 : ℕ) ^ 2 - 42 + 41` = `1764 - 42 + 41` = `1722 + 41 = 1763`.

Now, `p(n+1) = (n+1)² - (n+1) + 41 = (n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1) + 41 = (n² + n) + 41`.

But in Lean, `(n+1 : ℕ) ^ 2 - (n+1 : ℕ)` is not necessarily `n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1` (in math), because if `n+1 > n² + n + 1` (`n² + n + 1 < n + 1` would require `n² < 0`, which is never true for `n ≥ 1`), but for `n = 1`, `(1+1)^2 - (1+1)` is `4 - 2` is `2`, and in math `n² + n + 1 = 3` and `n + 1 = 2`, so `(n+1)^2 - (n+1) = 4 - 2 = 2`.

In Lean, for `n = 1`:
`p(n) = p(1) = 1² - 1 + 41 = 41`, `p(n+1) = p(2) = 2² - 2 + 41 = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43`.

Now, `Nat.gcd (p 1) (p 2) = Nat.gcd 41 43 = 1`.

But the hypothesis in the Lean theorem is that this is `> 1`. So the statement is vacuously true for `n = 1`.

Similarly, we can check `n = 41`:
`p(41) = 41² - 41 + 41 = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681`, `p(42) = 42² - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763`.

Then `Nat.gcd (1681) (1763) = 41` because `1763 - 1681 = 82`, and `1681 / 41 = 41`, so `41` divides both.

But if `n = 40`:
`p(40) = 40² - 40 + 41 = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601`, `p(41) = 1681`.

`Nat.gcd (1601) (1681)`:
`1681 - 1601 = 80`, `1601 - 80*20 = 1601 - 1600 = 1`.

So `Nat.gcd(1601, 1681) = 1`, because no common factor other than `1` exists. 

Thus, it seems that if `n < 41`, then `Nat.gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1`. But the hypothesis is that `Nat.gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, so `n ≥ 41`.

But is `Nat.gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1` always true for `n < 41`? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps we need to compute `p(n+1) - p(n)`:

`p(n+1) = (n+1)² - (n+1) + 41 = (n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1) + 41 = (n² + n) + 41`.

`p(n) = n² - n + 41`.

Thus, `p(n+1) - p(n)` in math is `(n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`. 

In Lean:
`p(n+1) - p(n)`:
`((n+1)² - (n+1) + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = ((n² + 2n + 1) - (n + 1)) + 41 - (n² - n + 41)` = but `(n² + 2n + 1) - (n + 1)` is `n² + n` (as `n² + 2n + 1 ≥ n + 1` for all `n ≥ 0` because `n² + n ≥ 0`), and `n² - n + 41` is `n² - n + 41` (no issues because `n² ≥ n` unless `n=1`, but `n² + n + 41 ≥ n² - n + 41` because `2n ≥ 0`). So perhaps we have `p(n+1) - p(n)` is `(n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`, where `-` is truncated subtraction, and math subtraction are the same because `(n² + n + 41) ≥ (n² - n + 41)` since `n ≥ 0` (`n` is natural number). 

Indeed:
- For `n = 0`, `p(n+1) - p(n) = 41 - 41 = 0`, `2n = 0`.
- For `n = 1`, `p(n+1) = 43`, `p(n) = 41`, `43 - 41 = 2`, `2n = 2`.

In general, since `n ≥ 0`, `(n+1)² - (n+1) = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 = n² + n` (`≥ n² - n`), so:
`p(n+1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41)` is `(n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41)` is `(n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41)` = `n² + n + 41 - (n² - n + 41)`.
If `n ≥ 1`, `n² + n ≥ n² - n` (because `n ≥ 0`). So `n² + n + 41 ≥ n² - n + 41`, and the Lean subtraction is the same as math subtraction:
`n² + n + 41 - (n² - n + 41) = (n² + n + 41 - (n² - n + 41)) = 2n` (`n² - n + 41 ≤ n² + n + 41`).

But for `n = 0`, `p(n+1) - p(n) = 0 - 0 = 0`, and `2n = 0`. 

But the problem is that we don't actually have `p(n+1) - p(n)` in Lean; we have `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`.

We can instead observe that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))` divides `p(n + 1) - p(n)` (`Nat.gcd a b` divides `a` and `b`, so it divides any linear combination of `a` and `b`). 

But `p(n + 1) - p(n)` is `2n` as numbers (and also as natural numbers, as long as `n ≥ 0` because we checked earlier that the subtraction is well-defined). 

This means that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))` divides `2n`. 

But `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` is a hypothesis. 

Now, `p(n) = n² - n + 41 = (n - 1) n + 41` (if `n ≥ 1`), but for `n = 0`, `p(0) = 41`. 

We can check:

We need to find `d > 1` that divides both `p(n)` and `p(n+1)`.

Since `d` divides `p(n+1) - p(n) = 2n`, we must have `d` divides `2n`.

But we need to find if `d > 1` is possible for `n < 41`.

For `n < 41`, the only common divisors can come from primes `≤ 41`.

So we need to check if `p(n)` is prime for `n < 41`.

This seems hard, but we can look for primes `q` that divide both `p(n)` and `p(n+1)`.

But we know that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n)`, because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)` and `p(n+1) - p(n) = 2n`. 

This is useful because `p(n) = n² - n + 41`.

So, if `gcd(p(n), 2n) > 1`, this means that some prime divides both `p(n)` and `2n`. 

But `gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.

Notice that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(-n + 41, n)` (because `gcd(n² - n, n) = n` divides `n` so `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(-n + 41, n)`).

Thus, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2 * gcd(-n + 41, n) = 2 * gcd(n - 41, n)` (because `gcd(-n + 41, n) = gcd(n - 41, n)`).

But `gcd(n - 41, n)` divides `41`. 

Since `n < 41`, `gcd(n - 41, n) = gcd(0, n) = n` or `gcd(41 - n, n)`. 

This suggests that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` must divide `2 * gcd(41 - n, n)`.

So, for `n < 41`, `41 - n > 0` is natural.

Therefore, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` must divide `2 * gcd(41 - n, n)`.

But `n < 41`, so `gcd(41 - n, n)` divides `41`. 

If `n ≥ 2`, `gcd(41 - n, n)` is `gcd(41, n)` because `gcd(41 - n, n) = gcd(41, n)` (since `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a - b, b)`).

Thus, `gcd(41 - n, n)` is either `1` or a divisor of `41` (`41` is prime). 

Thus, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2 * gcd(41, n)`.

Therefore, if `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n) > 1`, then `n` must be divisible by some prime factor of `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`.

But `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is even (`> 1`), and so is `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`, so if it divides `2 * gcd(41, n)`, it can only be divisible by primes of `2` or of `n`.

If `n` is not divisible by `2`, then `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` must be `2`. 

But if `n` is not even, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `2` (because `n² - n + 41` is odd). 

So for `n` odd and `n < 41`, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` (`2n` can be reduced by dividing by `2` since it's even, but `n` is odd).

`gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` is `gcd(41, n)` (`n` and `n² - n` are both divisible by `n`). 

So `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` is `gcd(41, n)` (a divisor of `41`).

But if `n` is prime and `n ≠ 41`, then `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(41, n)` (`n` or `1` if `n` does not divide `41`).

However, since `n < 41` and `n` is prime, then `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(41, n)` (`gcd` of a prime `n` with `41` is `n` if `n = 41`, but `n < 41`). 

But in our problem, `n < 41`, so `gcd(41, n)` is `n` if `n` is prime, but if `n` is composite, `gcd(41, n)` is `gcd(n, 41)` is `1` (if `n ≠ 41`). 

But if `n < 41` and `n` is not `41`, then `gcd(41, n)` is `1`, and `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` divides `2 * gcd(41, n)` is `2`. 

But we know that if `n` is not divisible by `2` and `n < 41`, then `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `2` because `n² - n + 41` is odd (`n² - n` is even and `+41` is odd).

Wait, so this seems that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `2` for all odd `n < 41`. 

Indeed, we calculated earlier that for `n = 1`, `gcd(p(1), p(2)) = 1`. Wait, no. 

`p(1) = 41`, `p(2) = 43`. 

`gcd(41, 43) = 1`. 

But we thought that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 2` for odd `n < 41`? 

But we got that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1` for `n = 1`. 

But in our proof, we seem to have an inconsistency, because `n = 1` is odd, and we thought that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 2`. But in fact, `gcd(41, 43) = 1`. 

So the conclusion that `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `2` is incorrect because for `n = 1`, it's `gcd(41, 2)` is `1`. 

Wait, but earlier, `p(n+1) - p(n) = 2n` is `2` when `n = 1`, and `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(41, 43) = 1`.

Our general statement was that `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`. But here `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(p(n), p(n+1) - p(n))` is `gcd(p(n), 2n)`.

But in the case `n = 1`, `gcd(p(1), 2*1) = gcd(41, 2) = 1`, and `p(1)` is `41`. 

Thus, `gcd(p(n), 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)`. 

But `gcd(p(n), p(n+1))` is `gcd(p(n), 2n)`. 

Thus, if `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, then `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is not `1`, and `n` cannot be `< 41`. 

We need to prove that for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), 2n)` is `1`.

We can compute `p(n)` for `n < 41` (`n` from `1` to `40`) and check that `gcd(p(n), 2n) = 1`.

In fact, for each `n < 41`, we need to check if `n² - n + 41` is divisible by any of the prime factors of `2n`.

Note that:
- If `n` is divisible by `2` but not by any prime, i.e., `n = 2`, check `p(2) = 43` and `2n = 4`, `gcd(43, 4) = 1`.
- If `n` is divisible by `2`, then `p(n)` must be divisible by `2`, but `p(n) = n² - n + 41` is odd (`n² - n` is `n(n-1)` is even, so `p(n)` is `even + odd = odd`). So if `n` is even, `2` cannot divide `p(n)`. 

Actually, `n` and `n - 1` are consecutive, so one is even, so `n(n-1)` is always even. Thus, `n² - n + 41` is `even + odd = odd` (in `ℕ`). 

So `p(n)` is odd for all `n ∈ ℕ`. 

This means that if `n > 1` and `n` is odd, then `gcd(p(n), 2n)` is `gcd(p(n), n)` (because `p(n)` is odd and thus `gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(p(n), n)`). 

But `gcd(p(n), n) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)` (`gcd(n² - n, n) = n`, so `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`). 

Thus, if `n < 41`, then `gcd(41, n)` is `n` if `n` is `41`, otherwise it is `1` (since `41` is prime). But `n < 41`, so `gcd(41, n) = 1`, unless `n = 41`.

But we assumed `n < 41`, so `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = 1` if `n < 41`. 

Similarly, if `n` is even, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2) * gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` if `n` and `2` are coprime. 

But `n² - n + 41` is odd, so `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2) = 1`. 

Thus, `gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` is `gcd(41, n)` (as before).

So, if `n < 41`, `gcd(41, n) = 1` unless `n` is `41`. 

Thus, if `n < 41`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n) = gcd(41, n) = 1`.

But the problem assumes `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, so `n` must be `≥ 41`.

But actually, for `n = 0`:
`p(0) = 41`, `p(1) = 41`.
`gcd(p(0), p(1)) = 41 > 1`.

But the hypothesis `n > 0` is given, so `n ≥ 1`. 

Thus, for `n ≥ 1` and `n < 41`, we have that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1`. 

But the hypothesis is that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, so it must be that `n ≥ 41`.

However, for `n = 41`, we have `p(n) = 1681 = 41²`, `p(n+1) = 42² - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763`.

But `gcd(1681, 1763) = 41` because `1763 = 41 * 43`.

Thus, we conclude that if `n ≥ 41`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) ≥ 1`, and the condition is that `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1` implies `n ≥ 41` (because if `n < 41`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1`).

**But wait**, is the converse true? That for `n ≥ 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`? Not necessarily, for example, `n = 43`:

`p(43) = 43² - 43 + 41 = 1849 - 43 + 41 = 1847`.

`p(44) = 44² - 44 + 41 = 1936 - 44 + 41 = 1933`.

`gcd(1847, 1933)`:
Check if `1933 - 1847 = 86`.

`gcd(1847, 86)`:
`1847 - 21 * 86 = 1847 - 1806 = 41`.
`gcd(86, 41) = 41`.
Thus, `gcd(1847, 1933) = 41 > 1`.

Another example, `n = 42`:

`p(42) = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763`.

`p(43) = 1847`.

`gcd(1763, 1847)`:
`1847 - 1763 = 84`.
`gcd(1763, 84)`:
`1763 = 20 * 84 + 83`.
`gcd(84, 83) = 1`.
So `gcd(1763, 1847) = 1`.

Thus, the hypothesis `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` does not hold for `n = 42`, but we claim that if `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`.

However, in the Lean problem statement, the assumption is that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` implies `n ≥ 41`, but we saw that for `n = 42`, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`, so `n = 42` is not a counterexample because the hypothesis is false (`1 > 1` is false, so the implication is vacuously true).

Similarly, for `n = 43`, the implication is true (`41 > 1` is true, and `43 ≥ 41` is true).

However, we need to confirm that for `n < 41`, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`. 

We saw that for `n = 1`, `Nat.gcd (p 1) (p 2) = 1`, `n = 2`, `p(2) = 43`, `p(3) = 9 - 3 + 41 = 47`, `Nat.gcd(43, 47) = 1`.

For `n = 40`:

`p(40) = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601`.

`p(41) = 1681 = 41²`.

`Nat.gcd(1601, 1681) = 1` because `1681 - 1601 = 80`, `gcd(1601, 80)`:
`1601 = 20 * 80 + 1`, `gcd(80, 1) = 1`.

Thus, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` for `n < 41`.

But in the Lean theorem, the assumption is that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`, which implies that `n ≥ 41`.

**Summary of the proof:**

1. First, we show that for all `n < 41`, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`.
   - This can be done by checking individual cases (there are only 40 cases), or by noting that `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)` and `gcd(41, n) = 1` when `n < 41` (unless `n = 41`, which is excluded).

But given that this is a Lean proof, we might need to do case analysis or induct on `n` to show that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` for `n < 41`.

2. Next, we assume `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` and need to prove that `n ≥ 41`.
   - The contrapositive would be: if `n < 41`, then `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) ≤ 1`.
   - But since `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))` is always `≥ 1` and we know it is `≤ 1` when `n < 41`, this will give the result.

However, we have `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))` is `≥ 1` (since `Nat.gcd` is always `≥ 1`), and when `n < 41`, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`, so if `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

But Lean uses `n : ℕ`, and `n > 0`, so `n ≥ 1`. We can thus do a proof by contradiction:
- Assume `n < 41`, and derive `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` (but we have `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1`), a contradiction.

Thus, the theorem follows.

But we might need to write a lemma that for `n ≤ 40`, `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`.

### Step 1: Prove that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` for `n ≤ 40`.

This will require checking each `n ≤ 40` (`n` from `1` to `40`), but Lean cannot handle that by automation, so we have to do it by hand in Lean (which is tedious but feasible). 

### Step 2: Prove that if `n > 0` and `n < 41`, then `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1`, and thus `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` cannot happen.

But the theorem is stated as `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1 → 41 ≤ n`.

### Step 3: Since `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) > 1` cannot happen if `n < 41`, we must have `n ≥ 41`.

### Step 4: Conclude that `41 ≤ n`.

### Abstract Plan

1. **Preliminary Observations**:
   - `p(n) = n² - n + 41` (where subtraction is natural subtraction, but `n² - n` is always `≥ 0` since `n ≥ 1`).
   - For `n ≥ 1`, `p(n)` is always `≥ 41`.
   - `p(n+1) - p(n) = 2n`.
   - `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n)`.
   - For `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), 2n)` is `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` which is `gcd(41, n) = 1` (if `n < 41` and `n` is not `41`), because `41` is prime and `n < 41`.

2. **Key Lemma**:
   - For `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) = 1`.

3. **Main Proof**:
   - If `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, then `n` cannot be `< 41`.
   - Therefore, `n ≥ 41`.

### Detailed Proof and Analysis

#### Problem Analysis
We need to prove that if `n` is a positive integer, `p(x) = x² - x + 41` (interpreted as natural numbers), and `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`. 

First, we should verify that the function `p(x) = x² - x + 41` is correctly interpreted in Lean as a function `p : ℕ → ℕ`, where all operations are natural number operations. The issue here is that if `x = 0`, `p(0) = 0² - 0 + 41 = 41` (as Lean interprets `0 - 0` as `0` in naturals). However, if `x = 1`, `p(1) = 1² - 1 + 41 = 1 - 1 + 41 = 41`. But if `x = 2`, `p(2) = 2² - 2 + 41 = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43`. 

But notice that the condition `gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1` cannot hold for `n < 41`, as we will show below. 

However, this is not strictly true because, for example:
- If `n = 40`, `p(40) = 40² - 40 + 41 = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601` and `p(41) = 41² - 41 + 41 = 1681`. Then `gcd(1601, 1681) = gcd(1601, 80) = 1` (since `1681 = 1601 + 80` and `1601 = 20 * 80 + 1` and `80 = 80 * 1 + 0`). So, `gcd(1601, 1681) = 1` does not exceed `1`. 

This suggests that either the Lean formalization is incorrect, or perhaps the original problem statement in Lean is interpreted differently (e.g., with `p(x)` actually being `x² + x + 41` or something else). 

But no, the given Lean theorem states:
```lean4
theorem mathd_numbertheory_618 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) (p : ℕ → ℕ) (h₀ : ∀ x, p x = x ^ 2 - x + 41)
    (h₁ : 1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))) : 41 ≤ n := by sorry
```

Now, we notice that:
1. In Lean, `-` is the truncated subtraction for naturals. So `x - y = max(x - y, 0)` in integers. 
   - For `x ≥ y`, `x - y = x - y`.
   - For `x < y`, `x - y = 0`.

So, `p(x) = x² - x + 41` means:
- If `x² ≥ x`, `p(x) = x² - x + 41`.
- If `x² < x`, `p(x) = 0 + 41 = 41`.

But `x² < x` only holds when `x = 0` (because `x ≥ 1 ⇒ x² ≥ x`). Therefore:
- If `x = 0`, `p(0) = 0² - 0 + 41 = 0 + 41 = 41`.
- If `x > 0`, `p(x) = x² - x + 41`.

However, because `n > 0`, this becomes:
- For `x = n > 0`, `p(x) = x² - x + 41 = x(x - 1) + 41`.
  - Here, since `n ≥ 1`, `n² ≥ n` so `n² - n = n² - n` in Lean's `Nat` (not truncated).
- Similarly, `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + n + 1`.

However, for `n > 0`, `n² - n + 41` is indeed computed as `(n² - n) + 41`, and `n² - n` is the natural number subtraction since `n² ≥ n` for `n ≥ 1`.

The condition is `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`.

But notice that:
`p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 1) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n - 40`. 

However, this is in integers (`(n² + n + 1)` as `p(n + 1)` and `(n² - n + 41)` as `p(n)`).

In Lean's `Nat` terms:
`p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + n + 41`.
`p(n) = n² - n + 41`.
Then:
`p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n` (`-` as natural truncating subtraction).

But is `2n ≥ 0`? Only if `n ≥ 0`. Since `n > 0`, `2n ≥ 2 > 0`, so:
`p(n + 1) ≥ p(n) + 2n` (here `p(n + 1) - p(n)` is `2n` since no truncation). 

Now, we can calculate the actual `gcd` (as naturals) of `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)`:
Let `d = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n)`, because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)` and `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n` (`-` natural subtraction).

Thus, `d` divides `2n` (`d | 2n`). 

But in the original problem, it is assumed that `d > 1`.

Our goal is to prove that if `d > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`.

#### Observations:
1. For `n < 41`, we have `d | 2n` and `d > 1`. The maximum possible `d` is `2n` (`d ≤ 2n`), and to show that no such `d > 1` can divide both `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)` for `n < 41`, we might have to check each `n`.

But actually, it is enough to observe that:
`p(n) = n² - n + 41 ≡ 40 mod 2`, since `n² - n` is even (because `n² ≡ n mod 2`).

Therefore, `p(n) ≡ 0 mod d`, and also `2n ≡ 0 mod d`. Hence, `41 ≡ 0 mod d`, because `d` divides `p(n) + n` (`n | 2n` and `d | 2n`, and `d | p(n)`, but this doesn't directly give us `d | 41`). 

Wait:
`p(n) = n² - n + 41 ≡ 0 mod d`, and `2n ≡ 0 mod d`. So, `41 ≡ n² - n mod d`. 

However, since `d | 2n`, we have `n² ≡ n mod d` is not immediately helpful. 

Alternatively, since `d | 2n`, then if `n < 41`, `d ≤ 2n < 82`, so if `d > 1`, `d ∈ {2, 3, ..., 81}`. 

But in `p(n) = n² - n + 41` (`n² ≥ n` since `n ≥ 1`), notice that `p(n)` grows rapidly. 

For `n < 41`, we need to find the possible common divisors. 

But observe that:
- For `n ≤ 40`, `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)` are both bounded by `40² + 41 = 1681`. 

However, we need `d = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` for `n ≤ 40`, i.e., `d` is a common divisor. 

We can try to find all `n` such that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`. 

Alternatively, note that:
`p(n) ≡ 41 mod n` because:
`p(n) = n² - n + 41 ≡ -n + 41 ≡ 41 - n mod n`. 

Similarly, `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`. 

Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) ≡ gcd(41 - n, 41) = gcd(41, n)`.

Thus:
`gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41 - n, n) = gcd(41, n)`.

Hence, the condition that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` is equivalent to `gcd(41, n) > 1`, which is true if and only if `n` is divisible by a prime factor of `41`, i.e., `n` must be divisible by `41`.

But `41` is a prime number, so if `gcd(41, n) > 1`, then `41 | n`. But since `n > 0` (`n ≥ 1`), and `41 | n`, the smallest possible `n` is `41`. 

However, in our case, `n > 0`, and `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` is equivalent to `gcd(41, n) > 1`. Since `41` is prime, this implies that `41` divides `n`, hence `n ≥ 41`. 

But wait: the equivalence that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)` is true modulo `n` (`gcd(41, n)` divides `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))`), but is it exact? 

Let's check:
`gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41 - (n² - n + 41)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`.

Because `(n² + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = n`, `gcd(n² + 41, n² - n + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`. 

Now, `n² - n + 41 ≡ 0 mod gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`, so:
`41 ≡ n mod gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`.

Thus, `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)` divides `gcd(41, n)` because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(41 - n, n)` and `gcd(41 - n, n) = gcd(41, n)`. 

Conversely, `gcd(n² + 41, n)` also divides `gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`, so:
`gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`. 

Therefore:
`gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`. 

The condition that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` is equivalent to `gcd(41, n) > 1`. But since `41` is prime, `gcd(41, n) > 1` implies that `41` divides `n` (`41 | n`), and hence, since `n ≥ 1`, we must have `n ≥ 41`. 

#### Step 1: Derive `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`
- First, compute `p(n + 1) - p(n) = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41) = 2n`, but we need to use it modulo `n`.
  - Alternatively, observe that `p(n + 1) = n² + 41` and `p(n) = n² - n + 41`.
  - Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41)`.
  - Using `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`, `gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`. 
  - Now, `n² - n + 41 ≡ 41 - n ≡ 41 + (n - n) ≡ 41 mod n` because `n² ≡ 0 mod n`. Hence, `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`.
  - Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`.

#### Step 2: Use the assumption `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`
This implies that `gcd(41, n) > 1`. Since `41` is prime, this can happen only if `n` is divisible by `41`, i.e., `41 ≤ n`.

#### Step 3: Prove `n ≥ 41`
Since `n > 0` and `gcd(41, n) > 1`, we must have `41 | n` because `41` is prime. But then, since `n > 0`, `n ≥ 41`.

#### Formalization Details in Lean

However, the Lean formalization has a problem:
For `n = 1`, `p(n) = p(1) = 1² - 1 + 41 = 1 - 1 + 41 = 41` and `p(n + 1) = p(2) = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43`. Then `gcd(41, 43) = 1`, which is not `> 1`. 

But according to our proof, `gcd(41, n)` for `n = 1` is `gcd(41, 1) = 1`, which matches `gcd(41, 43) = 1`. 

Similarly, for `n = 2`, `p(n) = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43`, `p(n + 1) = 9 - 3 + 41 = 47`, `gcd(43, 47) = 1`, and `gcd(41, 2) = 1`, which matches. 

For `n = 40`, `p(n) = 1600 - 40 + 41 = 1601`, `p(n + 1) = 1681`, `gcd(1601, 1681) = 1` (as calculated above), and `gcd(41, 40) = 1`, which matches. 

But in the Lean statement, the condition is `h₁ : 1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))`. So no value of `n` satisfies this, which means that the hypothesis is vacuously true. But then the statement is `∀ n > 0, ... → 41 ≤ n`, and the conclusion is trivially `41 ≤ n` (even `n = 1` would satisfy the conclusion `41 ≤ 1`, which is false, but `1 < gcd(p(1), p(2)) = 1` is false). 

Wait, no, because the Lean hypothesis is `1 < gcd` (`h₁`). In our calculation for `n = 1`, `1 < gcd` is false, so `n = 1` is excluded. 

But now we realize that for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n) = 1` (since no number `≤ 40` is divisible by `41`). 

But for `n = 41`, `gcd(41, n) = 41`, and `p(n) = 1681`, `p(n + 1) = 1764`, `gcd(1681, 1764)` is `gcd(1681, 83) = gcd(83, 0) = 83 > 1`. So the Lean statement is correct. 

But when `n = 41`, the condition is satisfied. 

#### Conclusion of Analysis
The only possible way for `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` to hold is if `n ≥ 41` (`41 | n`). So we can structure the proof as:

1. First, show that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)` (using `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)` and `n² + 41 ≡ 0 mod gcd(41, n)`).
2. Since `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, this implies `gcd(41, n) > 1`.
3. Because `41` is prime, `41` must divide `n`.
4. Since `n > 0`, this implies `n ≥ 41`.

However, as I am checking now, if `n ≥ 41`, it does not automatically ensure `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` (e.g., `n = 42` gives `gcd(41, n) = 1`). So this must have been intended to require `41 ≤ n`. 

Upon re-reading, in the Lean formalization, the hypothesis is `1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))`, so it is correct to assume that `n ≥ 41` (e.g., `n = 83` gives `gcd(41, n) = 41`). 

So to verify:
For `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n) = 1`, so `1 < gcd(...)` does not hold. 

For `n = 41`, `gcd(41, n) = 41 > 1`. 

For `n > 41` and `41 | n` (e.g., `n = 41 * k`), `gcd(41, n) = 41 > 1`. 

For `n > 41` and `41` does not divide `n` (e.g., `n = 42`), `gcd(41, n) = 1` (as `41` is prime).

Therefore, the statement is correct. 

#### Main Proof

1. We first note that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)` for `n > 0`. 
   - This is because:
     - `p(n) = n² - n + 41` and `p(n + 1) = n² + 41`.
     - `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, (n² + 41) - (n² - n + 41)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`.
     - But `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)` because `n² - n + 41 ≡ 41 mod n`.

2. Therefore, if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `gcd(41, n) > 1`.

3. Since `41` is prime, `gcd(41, n) > 1` implies that `41` divides `n` (`41 | n`). 

4. Therefore, `n ≥ 41`. 

#### Step 4: Intermediate Steps in Lean

1. Prove `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)` (`p(n) = n² - n + 41`, `p(n + 1) = n² + 41`).
2. From `h₁ : 1 < gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))`, deduce `gcd(41, n) > 1`.
3. Since `41` is prime, `41 | n` (by `Nat.Prime.dvd_of_dvd_pow`, `Nat.Prime.dvd_iff_ne_one`).
4. Hence `n ≥ 41`. 

However, the hypothesis includes `n > 0`, which is needed to ensure that `n² - n` is correctly truncated (`n² ≥ n`). 

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Compute p(n) and p(n + 1):**
   - For `n > 0`, `p(n) = n² - n + 41` (since `n² ≥ n` as `n ≥ 1`).
   - `p(n + 1) = (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 = n² + n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n² + 41`.

2. **Simplify the gcd:**
   - Compute `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n² + 41) = gcd(n² - n + 41, n)`.
   - Further simplify: `gcd(n² - n + 41, n) = gcd(41, n)`.

3. **Use the condition:**
   - Since `1 < gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(41, n)`, we get `gcd(41, n) > 1`.
   - Since `41` is prime and `gcd(41, n) > 1`, this implies `41 | n`.

4. **Conclude:**
   - Since `n > 0` and `41 | n`, the smallest possible `n` is `n = 41`.

### Detailed Proof and Analysis

First, we need to understand the problem and the given hypotheses:
1. **Problem Statement**: Prove that if `n > 0` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)` is greater than `1`, where `p(x) = x² - x + 41`, then `n ≥ 41`.
2. **Assumptions**:
   - `n > 0` (`n` is a positive integer).
   - `p(x) = x² - x + 41`.
   - `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`.
3. **Goal**: Prove that `n ≥ 41`.

#### Key Observations:
1. The function `p(x) = x² - x + 41` is the same as `(x - 1)² + 40` because `x² - x = (x - 1)² - 1` does not seem directly useful here. However, the form `x² - x + 41` is important.
2. For small values of `n`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` can be computed directly:
   - For `n = 1`, `p(1) = 1 - 1 + 41 = 41` and `p(2) = 4 - 2 + 41 = 43`, `gcd(41, 43) = 1`.
   - For `n = 2`, `p(2) = 43` and `p(3) = 9 - 3 + 41 = 47`, `gcd(43, 47) = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, `p(3) = 47` and `p(4) = 16 - 4 + 41 = 53`, `gcd(47, 53) = 1`.
   - For `n = 4`, `p(4) = 53` and `p(5) = 25 - 5 + 41 = 61`, `gcd(53, 61) = 1`.
   - For `n = 5`, `p(5) = 61` and `p(6) = 36 - 6 + 41 = 71`, `gcd(61, 71) = 1`.
   - For `n = 6`, `p(6) = 71` and `p(7) = 49 - 7 + 41 = 83`, `gcd(71, 83) = 1`.
   - For `n = 7`, `p(7) = 83` and `p(8) = 64 - 8 + 41 = 97`, `gcd(83, 97) = 1`.
   - For `n = 8`, `p(8) = 97` and `p(9) = 81 - 9 + 41 = 113`, `gcd(97, 113) = 1`.
   - For `n = 9`, `p(9) = 113` and `p(10) = 100 - 10 + 41 = 131`, `gcd(113, 131) = 1`.
   - For `n = 10`, `p(10) = 131` and `p(11) = 121 - 11 + 41 = 151`, `gcd(131, 151) = 1`.
   - For `n = 11`, `p(11) = 151` and `p(12) = 144 - 12 + 41 = 173`, `gcd(151, 173) = 1`.
   - For `n = 12`, `p(12) = 173` and `p(13) = 169 - 13 + 41 = 197`, `gcd(173, 197) = 1`.
   - For `n = 13`, `p(13) = 197` and `p(14) = 196 - 14 + 41 = 223`, `gcd(197, 223) = 1`.
   - For `n = 14`, `p(14) = 223` and `p(15) = 225 - 15 + 41 = 251`, `gcd(223, 251) = 1`.
   - For `n = 15`, `p(15) = 251` and `p(16) = 256 - 16 + 41 = 281`, `gcd(251, 281) = 1`.
   - For `n = 16`, `p(16) = 281` and `p(17) = 289 - 17 + 41 = 313`, `gcd(281, 313) = 1`.
   - For `n = 17`, `p(17) = 313` and `p(18) = 324 - 18 + 41 = 347`, `gcd(313, 347) = 1`.
   - For `n = 18`, `p(18) = 347` and `p(19) = 361 - 19 + 41 = 383`, `gcd(347, 383) = 1`.
   - For `n = 19`, `p(19) = 383` and `p(20) = 400 - 20 + 41 = 421`, `gcd(383, 421) = 1`.
   - For `n = 20`, `p(20) = 421` and `p(21) = 441 - 21 + 41 = 461`, `gcd(421, 461) = 1`.
   - For `n = 21`, `p(21) = 461` and `p(22) = 484 - 22 + 41 = 503`, `gcd(461, 503) = 1`.
   - For `n = 22`, `p(22) = 503` and `p(23) = 529 - 23 + 41 = 547`, `gcd(503, 547) = 1`.
   - For `n = 23`, `p(23) = 547` and `p(24) = 576 - 24 + 41 = 593`, `gcd(547, 593) = 1`.
   - For `n = 24`, `p(24) = 593` and `p(25) = 625 - 25 + 41 = 641`, `gcd(593, 641) = 1`.
   - For `n = 25`, `p(25) = 641` and `p(26) = 676 - 26 + 41 = 691`, `gcd(641, 691) = 1`.
   - For `n = 26`, `p(26) = 691` and `p(27) = 729 - 27 + 41 = 743`, `gcd(691, 743) = 1`.
   - For `n = 27`, `p(27) = 743` and `p(28) = 784 - 28 + 41 = 797`, `gcd(743, 797) = 1`.
   - For `n = 28`, `p(28) = 797` and `p(29) = 841 - 29 + 41 = 853`, `gcd(797, 853) = 1`.
   - For `n = 29`, `p(29) = 853` and `p(30) = 900 - 30 + 41 = 871 + 41 = 941 - 871 is not clear, but we note that 853 = 23 * 37`, `871 = 13 * 67`, `941 is prime, 941 - 941 = 0 not useful`. Actually `853 = 871 - 18 = 871 - (729 - 513 is not directly helpful. Alternatively, compute gcd(853, 941)` by Euclidean algorithm: 941 = 853 + 88, 853 = 9 * 88 + 41, 88 = 2 * 41 + 6, 41 = 6 * 6 + 5, 6 = 1 * 5 + 1, 5 = 5 * 1 + 0, so gcd(853, 941) = 1.
   - For `n = 30`, `p(30) = 900 - 30 + 41 = 911` is prime, `p(31) = 961 - 31 + 41 = 971` is prime, `gcd(911, 971)` is 1 since both are primes and 911 < 971.
   - For `n = 41`, `p(41) = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681` and `p(42) = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763 = 13 * 135 + 8, not obvious. Actually, `1763 ÷ 13 = 135 + 8/13`, so `1763 = 13 * 135 + 8`, not useful. It is better to factor `1763 = 41 * 43`, because `41` is already part of `p(41) = 41² = 1681`, and `43 = 41 + 2`. So `gcd(p(41), p(42)) = gcd(1681, 1763) = gcd(1681, 1763 - 1681) = gcd(1681, 82) = gcd(82, 1681 - 82 * 20 = 82 * 20 = 1640, 1681 - 1640 = 41) = gcd(82, 41) = 41`.
   But for `n = 41`, `gcd(p(41), p(42)) = 41 > 1`.
3. From the above computations, it seems that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` is a rare event and only occurs when `n ≥ 41`. This suggests that the statement is correct, and for `n < 41`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1` always.

However, we need to prove that if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`.

#### Deriving the Proof:

1. Let `g = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))`.
   - Since `g` divides both `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)`, it divides any linear combination of them.
   - We compute `p(n + 1) - p(n)`:
     ```
     p(n + 1) - p(n) = ( (n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41 ) - (n² - n + 41)
                     = (n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41) - (n² - n + 41)
                     = (n² + n + 41) - (n² - n + 41)
                     = (n² + n + 41 - n² + n - 41) = 2n.
     ```
     So `g` divides `2n`.
   - Similarly, we can compute `p(n + 2) - 2p(n + 1) + p(n)`, because the sequence `p(n)` is quadratic, and its second differences should be constant.
     However, this is less useful here. Alternatively, observe that `g` must divide `p(n)` and `2n`, so `g` divides `gcd(p(n), 2n)`.

   A better approach is to compute `4p(n + 1) - (2n + 1)p(n)` to eliminate the `n²` and `n` terms, but this might not directly help.
   Alternatively, consider the polynomial form:
   The quadratic sequence can be studied using polynomial techniques.

   Notice that:
   ```
   p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1,
   p(n + 2) - p(n + 1) = 2(n + 1) + 1 = 2n + 3,
   ```
   so no constant difference exists, and the differences are increasing.

   The better approach is to compute `2p(n) - p(n + 1) = 2(n² - n + 41) - ((n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41) = 2n² - 2n + 82 - (n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41) = n² - 4n + 40`. 
   However, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` must also divide `2p(n) - p(n + 1) = n² - 4n + 40`.

   Next, compute `n² - 4n + 40 mod (p(n))` = `(n² - n + 41) + (-3n - 1)` so:
   `n² - 4n + 40 ≡ (-3n - 1) mod (p(n))`. 
   Not sure if this helps.

   Alternatively, notice that `p(n) = n(n - 1) + 41` is `≥ n² - n + 41` for `n ≥ 1`.
   Therefore, unless `n` is very small, `p(n)` grows much faster than `2n`. So we can test small `n` and observe that `gcd > 1` is rare and only appears for `n ≥ 41`.

   Alternatively, the statement to prove is correct as per the computations for `n < 41`. 

   Here is a concrete approach: Since `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1`, and `g = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1))` divides `2n + 1`, and `g` divides `p(n)`, which is `n² - n + 41`.

   Also, `g` must divide `p(n + k(2n + 1))` for any integer `k`, by substitution. Let’s take `k = 2 - n` (or any `k` that makes the linear term vanish).

   Instead, perhaps the following is better: compute `4p(n + 1) - (2n + 1)p(n)`.

   We have:
   ```
   4p(n + 1) - (2n + 1)p(n) = 4(p(n + 1) - p(n)) + (4p(n) - (2n + 1)p(n))
                              = 4(2n + 1) + p(n)(4 - (2n + 1))
                              = 8n + 4 + p(n)(3 - 2n).
   ```
   However, `4p(n + 1) - (2n + 1)p(n)` can be expanded more directly to:
   ```
   4p(n + 1) = 4((n + 1)² - (n + 1) + 41) = 4(n² + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41) = 4(n² + n + 41) = 4n² + 4n + 164,
   (2n + 1)p(n) = (2n + 1)(n² - n + 41) = 2n³ - 2n² + 82n + n² - n + 41 = 2n³ - n² + 81n + 41.
   ```
   So, `4p(n + 1) - (2n + 1)p(n) = 4n² + 4n + 164 - 2n³ + n² - 81n - 41 = -2n³ + 5n² - 77n + 123`.
   Not obviously helpful.

   A better idea is to use the fact that `g` divides both `p(n)` and `2n + 1`, so it divides `n * p(n) + (n + 1)(2n + 1) p(n)`? No, not directly.
   
   A better approach is as follows:
   `g` divides both `p(n)` and `2n + 1`.
   Now, observe that:
   `(2n + 1) * p(n) = (2n + 1)(n² - n + 41) = 2n³ - 2n² + 82n + n² - n + 41 = 2n³ - n² + 81n + 41`.
   Compute `(n + 41) * p(n)`:
   ```
   (n + 41)p(n) = n * p(n) + 41 * p(n) = n(n² - n + 41) + 41(n² - n + 41) = n³ - n² + 41n + 41n² - 41n + 41² = n³ + 40n² + 41².
   ```
   Now, `(n + 41)p(n) - (2n + 1)p(n) = 40n² + (41² - 1) = 40n² + 1680`.
   Since `g` divides `(n + 41)p(n)` and `(2n + 1)p(n)`, it divides `40n² + 1680`. But also, `g` divides `2n + 1`. Since `g` divides `2n + 1`, it must divide `40n² + 1680` as follows:
   `(40n² + 1680) = 40n² + 40 * 42 = 40(n² + 42)`.
   Alternatively, to find `40n² + 1680 mod (2n + 1)`, we use `n ≡ -1/2 mod g`, so `n² ≡ 1/4 mod g` because `2n ≡ -1 mod g`, multiply by `(2n) ≡ -1` to get `4n² ≡ 1 mod g`. Then `40n² ≡ 10 mod g`, so `40n² + 1680 ≡ 10 + 1680 ≡ 1690 ≡ 0 mod g` only if `g` divides `1690 = 40n² + 1680` and `(2n + 1)` must be satisfied (`g` divides `(2n + 1)`). However, `1690` seems arbitrary and hard to factor.

   Let’s instead use the simpler observation that if `g` divides both `p(n)` and `2n + 1`, and `p(n)` is `n² - n + 41`, then:
   Write `d = gcd(n² - n + 41, 2n + 1)`.
   Let `m = n² - n + 41` and `k = 2n + 1`. Then, `k ≡ -1 mod (4k)`, and `m = n(n - 1) + 41 ≡ ( (k - 1)/2 )( (k - 1)/2 - 1 ) + 41 ≡ ( (k - 1)(k - 3)/4 + 41 mod k`).

   Expand `(k - 1)(k - 3)/4 = (k² - 4k + 3)/4 = k²/4 - k + 3/4` so `(k - 1)(k - 3)/4 ≡ 3/4 mod k` (assuming `4` is invertible mod `k`). 

   Not sure if this is simplifying things.

   A better idea is to observe that `d` divides both `n² - n + 41` and `2n + 1`. So we can solve for `n` from `2n ≡ -1 mod d`, and then substitute back into the first congruence.  

   Let `2n ≡ -1 mod d`. Then `n ≡ -1/2 mod d`. Substitute into `n² - n + 41 ≡ 0 mod d`:
   ```
   (1/4 + 1/2 + 41 ≡ 0 mod d, i.e., (1/4) + (2/4) + 41 ≡ 0 mod d, i.e., 3/4 + 41 ≡ 0 mod d, i.e., 167/4 ≡ 0 mod d.
   ```
   Since `167/4 ≡ 0 mod d` implies `167 ≡ 0 mod d`, because `4` is invertible modulo `d` (as `2n ≡ -1 mod d` cannot have both `n ≡ 0` and `d = 1` unless `0 ≡ -1 mod 1`, which is true, but then `d = 1`).
   Here we know that `d > 1`, but `2n + 1 ≡ 0 mod d` and `d` divides `2n + 1`, and the only possibility is `d` divides `167`, since `167` is prime (`d` must be `1` or `167`). We know `d > 1`, so `d = 167` (`d` cannot be larger than `2n + 1`, unless `n` is very large, but since `n` is arbitrary, it is better to check that `167` is prime).  

   So, `d` must be `167` (the only divisor `>1`), and thus `167` divides `2n + 1`, so `2n ≡ -1 mod 167` (not needed here), and also `167` divides `n² - n + 41`.
   Now, from `2n ≡ -1 mod 167`, we get `n ≡ -1/2 ≡ 83 mod 167` (since `2 * 83 = 166 ≡ -1 mod 167`). Thus, `n = 167k + 83` for some integer `k ≥ 0`. But we need `n ≥ 1`, so `k ≥ 0`. 

   But we need to prove that if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 41`. The above gives `n ≡ 83 mod 167` (`n = 83, 250, 417, …`), but it does not directly show that `n ≥ 41` (unless we consider that `n = 1, …, 82` is not a multiple of `167`, and check for `n ≤ 82` if the `gcd` can be `>1`). 

   But we need to prove `n ≥ 41`. However, if `n ≡ 83 mod 167`, then `n ≥ 83 > 41` (assuming `n ≥ 1` is given, and `n = 83, 250, …` is the solution). But our `n` in the hypothesis is `n > 0`, so the general solution is `n ≥ 83` (first valid `n ≡ 83 mod 167` is `n = 83`, next is `250`, etc.).

   But the hypothesis is `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` (`g ≥ 2`). We have seen that this implies `167` divides `2n + 1` (`n ≡ 83 mod 167`) and `167` divides `p(n)`. So, no smaller `n` works, and `n ≥ 41` is a much looser bound than `n ≡ 83 mod 167`.

   However, the problem assumes that `n > 0` is given, and `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, and asks us to prove `n ≥ 41`. So perhaps we should proceed by contradiction assuming `n < 41` and `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` is impossible (as per earlier computations).

   So, our approach will be:
   1. Assume `n < 41` (`n` is a positive integer, `1 ≤ n ≤ 40`).
   2. Compute `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)` explicitly for each `n` and observe that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.
   3. Since we must have `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` in the hypothesis, `n` cannot be `≤ 40`.

   But this is not rigorous, because for larger `n`, there may be cases where `gcd > 1` (we know `n ≡ 83 mod 167` makes `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`). However, since the hypothesis is `gcd > 1`, we have no restriction on `n` except `n > 0` (`n ≥ 1`), so we need to prove that `n` must be `≥ 41` when `gcd > 1`. 

   So perhaps the original statement was meant to have `gcd` divisible by some fixed integer (which is likely false), or something else. The computations indicate that `gcd > 1` can only occur when `n ≡ 83 mod 167`, in which case `n ≥ 83` (`n > 0` and `n ≡ 83 mod 167` implies `n ≥ 83`). 

   So, we can modify the proof strategy to show that if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n ≥ 83`.

   But the problem asks for `n ≥ 41`, which is a weaker condition (and `n ≥ 83` implies `n ≥ 41`).

   However, when `n ≤ 40`, we can manually check each case that `gcd ≤ 1`:
   - For `n ≤ 40`, we need to show that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) ≤ 1`.
     Here is a quick observation: `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1` is `≤ 81` (if `n ≤ 40`).
     Suppose `g = gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`.
     Let `d` be a prime divisor of `g`. Then `d` divides both `p(n)` and `2n + 1`. This means:
     - `d` divides `p(n) = n² - n + 41`,
     - `d` divides `2n + 1`. Thus, `n ≡ -1/2 mod d`.
     Substitute `n ≡ -1/2 mod d` into `p(n)`:
     ```
     p(n) ≡ (1/4) - (-1/2) + 41 ≡ (1/4) + (2/4) + 41 ≡ (3/4) + 41 ≡ (167)/4 ≡ 0 mod d.
     ```
     This means `4 * p(n) ≡ 0 mod d`, but we also know `2n ≡ -1 mod d`, so `4 * p(n) ≡ 0 mod d`.
     `p(n) ≡ 0 mod d` implies `41` is a solution to the quadratic `(x + 1/2)² - (x + 1/2) + 41 ≡ 0 mod d`, but:
     If `n ≡ -1/2 mod d`, then `n` is not an integer unless `d` is odd, which is fine.

     However, perhaps `d = 2` is allowed (`n` must be even or `2n + 1` is even, but `2n + 1` is always odd).
     So `d` must be odd (no `d = 2` is possible).

     Now, `p(n) ≡ 0 mod d` is `(1/4 + 1/2 + 41 ≡ 0 mod d)` (as above), so `167/4 ≡ 0 mod d` (`167 * 4^{-1} ≡ 0 mod d`), which implies that `d` divides `167`.

     Since `167` is prime, `d` must be `1` or `167`.

     So, `g` can have prime divisors `d` (i.e., `d` divides `g`), and these must be `1` or `167`.

     Hence, the only possible primes dividing `g` are `167`. 
     Therefore, `g` can only be a power of `167`. 

     However, in our case, we also have that `g` divides `2n + 1` and `n² - n + 41`.

     For `n ≤ 40`, `2n + 1 ≤ 81` (`2 * 40 + 1 = 81`), so if `g` divides `2n + 1`, the maximum possible `g` is `81` (if `2n + 1 = 81`).

     But if `g` is `167`, this is `> 81`, so `g` cannot be `167`.

     If `g` is a multiple of `167`, we must have `g = 0`, which is impossible (or perhaps `g ≥ 167`, which cannot divide `2n + 1 ≤ 81`).

     Therefore, the only possibility is `g = 1` (`n ≤ 40` implies `g ≤ 81`).

     In particular, `g ≤ 1` implies `g = 1`, so `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`. 

     However, if `n ≡ 83 mod 167` and `n > 40`, we could have `g ≥ 167` (if `g = 167`). 

     So, the only assumption that might fail is if `n` is not bounded (in particular, in the proof that `g ≤ 81` when `n ≤ 40`, we implicitly assume that `d` must divide `2n + 1 ≤ 81` for `g` to have any prime factors).

     To make this rigorous: if `n ≤ 40`, then `g` must be `≤ 2n + 1 ≤ 81`. Since we showed that all prime divisors of `g` are `167` or `≤` something, the maximum possible is `167`. So, either `g = 167`, or `g` is a power of `167` (but `2 * 40 + 1 = 81 < 167` means no such `n` exists). 

     Hence, if `n ≤ 40`, `g` cannot be a power of `167`, and the only prime divisor possible is `167`, which cannot be `g`.

     So, in fact, `g` must be `1` for `n ≤ 40`.

     Therefore, the condition `g > 1` implies that `n ≥ 41`.

However, in Lean, the hypothesis is `1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))` (`Nat.gcd` is at least `2`). But for `n ≤ 40`, we have `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` (`gcd` is `≤ 1` implies it is `1`). 

But we are assuming in Lean that `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) ≥ 2`. So it suffices to show that if `1 ≤ n ≤ 40`, then `Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) = 1` (since no `gcd` can be both `≥ 2` and `≤ 1`). 

However, in Lean, the statement is `(1 < Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1))) → (41 ≤ n)`. This is equivalent to proving the contrapositive: `(n < 41) → (Nat.gcd (p n) (p (n + 1)) ≤ 1)`, but since `gcd` is always `≥ 1`, this is `n < 41 → gcd = 1`. 

The approach will be:
1. Assume `n ≤ 40` (`n < 41`).
2. Compute `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`.
   - Note that `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)`.
3. We know that `p(n)` is `n² - n + 41` and `2n + 1` is `≤ 81` (`n ≤ 40`).
4. So, `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` divides `(2n + 1)`, but `(2n + 1)` is `≤ 81`.
5. The prime divisors of `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` must also divide `p(n)` (`n² - n + 41`).
6. From above, if `g = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` and `g > 1`, then `g` must be a power of `167`, because `g` divides `2n + 1` and `n² - n + 41`, so `g` divides `167`.
   But `g` divides `2n + 1 ≤ 81`, and `167` is `> 81`. Therefore, `g` cannot be `≥ 167` (`g` must be `1`). 

Alternatively, for `n ≤ 40`, `2n + 1 ≤ 81 < 167`. So `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1) ≤ 2n + 1 ≤ 81 < 167`.
Hence, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) ≤ 81` (if `n ≤ 40`), and the previous argument that `gcd` can only be `1` (if `n ≤ 40`).

#### Rigorous Conclusion:

We need to prove that if `n ≤ 40` and `n > 0`, then `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`. To do this:

1. For `1 ≤ n ≤ 40`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` because `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1`.
2. Compute `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)`. Since `p(n) = n² - n + 41` and `2n + 1` is small, check if they have common divisors:
   - The previous analysis suggests that `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` is either `1` or a divisor of `167`.
   - But `2n + 1 ≤ 81 < 167`, so no common divisor can be `≥ 167`.
   - Therefore, `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1) = 1` unless `n` is very special (but not in `1 ≤ n ≤ 40`).

But we can be more explicit: if `d > 1` divides `p(n) = n² - n + 41` and `2n + 1`, then `d` divides `4(41) = 164` (since `p( (2n + 1) * k )` can be expanded to find relations).
Alternatively, express `p(n)` in terms of `(2n + 1)`:

Write `p(n) = n² - n + 41`. We have:
`n² - n = (n² - n + 41) - 41 = p(n) - 41`. 
But we can also write `n² - n` as `( (2n + 1)² - 1 )/4 - ( (2n + 1) )/2 = ( (2n + 1)² - 1 - 2(2n + 1) )/4 = (4n² + 4n + 1 - 1 - 4n - 2)/4 = (4n²)/4 = n²`.
But `n² - n = ( (2n + 1)² - 1 - 2(2n + 1) )/4` seems not directly helpful. 

Another approach is to express `n` in terms of `k = 2n + 1` (`n = (k - 1)/2`), and substitute into `p(n)` to get:
`p(n) = ( (k - 1)/2 )² - ( (k - 1)/2 ) + 41 = (k² - 2k + 1)/4 - (k - 1)/2 + 41 = (k² - 2k + 1 - 2k + 2 + 164)/4 = (k² - 4k + 167)/4`. 

Now, if `d` divides both `p(n)` and `k = 2n + 1`, then `d` divides `k² - 4k + 167`, because `4 p(n) = k² - 4k + 167`, and `d` divides `p(n)`, so `d` divides `(k² - 4k + 167)` (as `d` divides `4 p(n)` is equivalent to `d` divides `k² - 4k + 167` (but only if `d` is odd))).

But `d` also divides `k = 2n + 1`, so it divides `k² - 4k` (since `k² - 4k = k(k - 4)`). Therefore, `d` divides `k² - 4k + 167 - (k² - 4k) = 167`. 

Hence, `d` must divide `167` (if `d` is odd, since `d` divides both `p(n)` (odd, because `n² - n` is always even and `41` is odd) and `k = 2n + 1` is odd, so `d` is odd).

Therefore, `d` must be `1` or `167`.

However, if `n ≤ 40`, `k ≤ 81` (`k = 2n + 1 ≤ 81`), so `d ≤ k ≤ 81 < 167`, so `d` cannot be `167`. 

But we must also consider the case when `d = 1` or `d > 1`. Since `d` cannot be `167` (if `n ≤ 40`), the only possibility is that `d = 1`.

Thus, for `n ≤ 40`, `gcd(p(n), 2n + 1) = 1`, hence `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`.

But in Lean, the hypothesis is `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, so if we know that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) ≤ 1` when `n ≤ 40`, we get that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` cannot happen for `n ≤ 40`. 

In other words, if `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n > 40` (`n ≥ 41`).

This completes the proof sketch.

### Step-by-Step Abstract Plan

1. **Understand the relationship between `p(n)` and `p(n + 1)`**:
   - Compute the difference `p(n + 1) - p(n) = 2n + 1`.
   - This implies that `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = gcd(p(n), 2n + 1)` because `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, b - a)`.

2. **Relate `p(n)` and `2n + 1` using algebraic manipulation**:
   - Express `p(n)` in terms of `k = 2n + 1` to get `p(n) = (k² - 4k + 167)/4`.
   - Deduce that if `d` is a common divisor of `p(n)` and `k`, then `d` divides `167` because `d` divides `p(n)` and `k`, hence `d` divides `k² - 4k + 167` and `k`, and hence `d` divides `167`.

3. **Restrict the possible values of `d`**:
   - `d` must be `1` or `167` because `167` is prime.
   - If `n ≤ 40`, then `k = 2n + 1 ≤ 81 < 167`, so `d` cannot be `167`.
   - Therefore, `d = 1` is the only possible common divisor for `n ≤ 40`.

4. **Conclude that for `n ≤ 40`, `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) = 1`**:
   - This contradicts the hypothesis `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1` if `n ≤ 40`.

5. **Final conclusion**:
   - If `gcd(p(n), p(n + 1)) > 1`, then `n` cannot be `≤ 40`, so `n ≥ 41`.
